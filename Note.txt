The aim of this rom is simple, keep it clean and tidy
This rom had all the good stuff, 
was super neat
better, updated, tweaked kernel & system
had a cleaner code & structure
very fast 
light wight
no extra/ unwanted stuffs/bloats
very minimal size
unified framework structure for c7 and c7 pro
add every variant support automatically
optimized stock interface with flagshipmods and tweaks in every corner possible
and rectify all the mistakes made in eulah v2 and older

This is one of my very satisfied release coz it turned out very well and i was happy with the response and outcome from the project
i was really satified with this release and the only problem it had was with c7 (c7000) which had trouble witj camera & sensors which i tried fixing by replacing with stock libs but still it didnt work for some  reason, the last time i tried was in 2021 for a user but still.. c7 has those bugs
in c7 pro it works flaulessly with no bugs at all, even my dad uses it as his daily driver ;)
